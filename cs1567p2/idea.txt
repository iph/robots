1. Determine R,G,B,A values of post-its

2. Gather collection of points for each post-it color ( O(n) on # of points )
    - for each point in cloud
        - if point.color matches color x 
            - add point to bucket x
    return buckets 

3. optionally process non-unique colors ( O(n^2) on # of colored points )
    - while bucket not empty
        - remove point from bucket and append to new list
        - 'grow' point
        - if point list <= NOISE discard 

    - 'grow' point:
        - gather adjacent points from bucket 
        - if points found
        -   remove them from bucket
        -   recurse
        -   add points to point list

3. Compute center of points in each color bucket ( O(n) on # of points )
    3.a average x/y/z of points in bucket

4. Find closet direction blob, compute vector

5. Transform centers/direction vectors to robot-world
